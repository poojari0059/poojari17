Koga and Ryuho are students of Mathematics. They like to play games. On a Sunday evening they planned to play a new game. Both have <b>N </b>boxes each having one or more coins. Boxes are numbered from <b>0</b> to <b>N-1</b>. Koga's <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> box has <b>A</b>[i] number of coins and Ryuho's <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> box has <b>B</b>[i] number of coins.
</p>



Game has the following rules:-
<ul>
<li>Initially both Koga and Ryuho have zero coins.</li>
<li>The players move in alternating turns, with Koga always moving first. During each move, if the current player is Koga then he must choose the <b> i<sup>th</sup></b> box from its own set of box and collect <b>A</b>[i] coins. If the current player is Ryuho, then  he must choose the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> box from its own set of box and collect <b>B</b>[i]  coins.</li>
<li>Each box can be chosen only once meaning that the game always ends after <b>N</b> moves.</li>
<li>If  Koga chooses i<sup>th</sup> box then the i<sup>th</sup> box can't be chosen by Ryuho from its own set of box or vice versa.</li>
<li>The player with the maximum number of coins will win.</li>
</ul>
 

<b>Input Format</b><br>
The first line of input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. <br>
Each test case contains <b>3</b> lines describing the test case.<br>
1. An integer  <b>N</b> denoting the number of boxes each player has.<br>
2. <b>N </b>space separated integers denoting number of coins in Koga's <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> box.<br>
3. <b>N</b> space separated integer denoting number of coins in Ryuho's <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> box.<br><br>

<b>Constraints</b>
<ul>
<li>1<=<b>T</b><=10</li>
<li>0<=<b>N</b><=10<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>1<=<b>A</b>[i],<b></b>[i]<=10<sup>5</sup>
</ul>
<b>Output Format</b><br>
For each test case, print one of the following predicted outcomes of the game on a new line:
<ul>
<li>Print  <b>KOGA</b> if Koga  will win.</li>
<li>Print <b>RYUHO</b>  if Ryuho will win.</li>
<li>Print <b>TIE</b>  if both the players will have same number of coins.</li>
</ul>

<b>Sample Input</b> <br>
2<br>
2<br>
8 8<br>
9 9<br>
3<br>
1 3 5<br>
5 3 1<br><br>

<b>Sample output</b><br>
RYUHO<br>
KOGA<br><br>
<b>Explanation</b><br>
<b>Test Case #00:</b> A{8,8},  B{9,9}<br>
Both the players will only make 1 move each and all the possible number of coins collected by Ryuho will be greater than all the possible number of coins<br> collected by  Koga, so 
Ryuho will win the game. Thus, we print  RYUHO on a new line.<br>

<b>Test Case #01: </b>A{1,3,4},  B{5,3,1}<br>
  Games end with the following N moves<br>
1.	 Koga chooses 2<sup>nd</sup> box  and  collects 4 coins.<br>
2.	Ryuho chooses  0<sup>th</sup> box and collects 5 coins. Note that Ryuho  will not choose 1<sup>st</sup> box , because this would lead Koga to win.<br>
3.	Koga chooses 1<sup>st</sup> box (which is the only remaining move) and collects  3 coins.<br>
                  As all the moves have been made, the game ends. Koga will have 7 coins and Ryuho  <br>will have 5 coins,
                  so Koga  is the winner so we print  KOGA in a new line.<br>
