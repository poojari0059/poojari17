<p>

A shepherd has a flock of sheep which he takes for grazing each day before sunset. There is always a wolf who is on a lookout for lost sheep so that he can have a good meal at night.
The shepherd doesn't want the sheep to be lost so he has to make sure the sheep stay within an area of <b>A</b> m<sup>2</sup>. He makes sure the area which he covers is always in the shape of a lattice polygon. He has also marked <b>I</b> flags inside the area at the lattices for the sheep to stay near inside. But he has realized that sometimes the sheep reach outside the bounded area as there are no flags at the boundary to warn them.<br>Can you help the shepherd and tell him how many <b>minimum</b> flags should be there at the boundary to enclose the area of <b>A</b> m<sup>2</sup> so that his sheep are not eaten by the hungry wolf?

<b>Input Format</b><br>
The first line of input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. <br>
Each test case contains <b>2 </b> values, <b>A</b> and <b>I</b> respectively.<br>

<b>Constraints</b>
<ul>
<li>1<=<b>T</b><=10</li>
<li>1<=<b>A</b><=10<sup>5</sup></li>
<li>1<=<b>I</b><=10<sup>5</sup>
</ul>
<b>Output Format</b><br>
For each test case, print the <b>minimum</b> number of flags the shepherd should put at the boundary of the area at new line for each test case.
