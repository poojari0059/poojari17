<p>Team Adaventure are always happy to do adventurous jobs, but this time they have a difficult job. They have a bar of length <b>M</b>  metres which is initially black and also four types of brushes of width 4 metres, 3 metres, 2 metres and 1 metre which is used to paint the rod with green, white, blue,and yellow color respectively. There is unlimited amount of color of each cateogry.
 They have to find number of different ways to paint the bar such that:
<ul>
<li>The whole bar should be painted.</li>
<li>No color should be overlapped (same type also).</li>
<li>At the time of painting, whole width of the brush should be in contact with the surface of the bar.</li>
</ul>
Can you help team Adaventure to find the different number of ways to paint the bar?
