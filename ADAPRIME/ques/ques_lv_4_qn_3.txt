 Abhinav has special type of torch which transmits a light which is either of blue or yellow color with probability <b>B</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively. He has two machines <b>M1</b> and <b>M2</b>, by which he can identify the colour of the light correctly. The light emitted from the torch is received by the machine <b>M1</b> and then transmitted to machine <b>M2</b>. The probability that each machine receives the light correctly is <b>C</b>. If he has found that the signal received by machine <b>M2</b> is blue, then he wants to find the probability that the original light was also blue.

<b>Input Format</b><br>
First line of the input has an integer <b>T</b>. <b>T</b> cases follow. <br>
Each test case contains <b>B</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>C</b> separated by space.<br><br> 


<b>Constraints</b>
<ul>
<li>1<=<b>T</b><=10<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>0<<b>B</b>,<b>Y</b>,<b>C</b><1</li>
</ul>
<b>Output Format</b><br>
For each test case, print the probability that original light was blue in a new line.<br><br>
Output should be upto two precision after decimal<br>
