A road construction company XYZ got a contract by Goverment of Canada to construct road. For construction they have provided a map which denotes the connection between cities and the cost (in dollars) to construct each road between the cities. Company have to construct road according to the given map only. The Goverment is only paying $10,000 for this work apart from the construction cost of roads to the company XYZ. The CEO of the company realises that $10,000 is a very small amount and he refuses to carry on with work. The Goverment replied to the CEO,"You will be paid the construction cost according to the original map, but you can make profit by modifying the map, but take care that there should at least be a path to travel from one city to the other city". Can you help the CEO to maximize the profit?

<b>Input Format</b><br>
First line of the input has two integer <b>N</b>(no. of cities) and <b>R</b>(no. of roads).<br>
Next <b>R</b> lines contain 3 integers <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> (source), <b>D<sub>i</sub></b>(destination) and  <b>C<sub>i</sub></b>(cost) of i<sup>th</sup> road separated by space.<br><br>

<b>Constraints</b>
<ul>
<li>2<=<b>N</b><=10<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>1<=<b>R</b><=(N(N-1))/2</li>
<li>1<=<b>S,D</b><=N</li>
<li>1<=<b>C</b><=10<sup>3</sup>
</ul>
<b>Output Format</b><br>
For each test case, print the minimum cost to construct the roads to maximize the profit in a new line.<br><br>
