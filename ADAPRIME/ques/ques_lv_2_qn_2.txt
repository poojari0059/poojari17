Ground Force Chief : Well, here conditions are pretty worse. All the possible bio-weapons can be hidden in destinations here. 
Fortunately we can visit all these destinations by roads from home. We have a map of this area. You need to design a program that
will take the locations, roads, our speed and our available time to tell the count of destinations that can be visited within available time. 
Good luck soldier!<br>
<b>Note</b>: <li>Destination '0' is Home from where you have to start and reach again.</li>
</p>

<b>Input Format</b><br>
First line of the input has an integer <b>N</b> (number of destinations), <b>R</b> (number of roads), <b>S</b> (speed in km/hr), <b>T</b> (time in hour) separated by space.<br>
Next <b>R</b> lines contain 3 integers <b>D<sub>i</sub>, D<sub>j</sub></b>
(denotes road between destination D<sub>i</sub> and D<sub>j</sub>) and <b>D</b>
(denotes distance between destinition D<sub>i</sub> and D<sub>j</sub> in km)
separated by space.<br><br>

<b>Constraints</b>
<ul>
<li>2<=<b>N</b><=10<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>1<=<b>R</b><=(N(N-1))/2</li>
<li>0<=<b>D<sub>i</sub>,D<sub>j</sub></b>< N </li>
<li>0<<b>T,S,D</b><=10<sup>2</li>
</ul>
<b>Output Format</b><br>
An integer representing number of destinations as available options that can be visited in given time.<br><br>
<b>Sample Input</b> <br>
7
6 3 5<br>

5 6 3

<br><br>

<b>Sample output</b><br>
4<br><br>
<b>Explanation</b><br>
