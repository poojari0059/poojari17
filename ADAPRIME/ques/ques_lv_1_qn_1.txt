Lieutenant : As a part of top intelligence, you have to tackle various day to day problems too. Our one of the scientists is fond of a farm of hens and cows but don't have time to manage them. Unfortunately, they are kept in a collective farm. Our scientists love to have regular count of hens in the farm. For the purpose he installed IoT pressure sensors
to calculate number of feet and camera to calculate number of heads. Now you need to calculate number of hens to be broadcasted. <Cough> Don't consider it as a silly job.

Next <b>T</b> lines contain two integer <b>H</b>(number of heads) and <b>L</b>(number of legs) separated by space.<br><br>

<b>Constraints</b>
<ul>
<li>1<=<b>T</b><=10<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>0<=<b>H,L</b><=10<sup>18</sup></li>
</ul>
<b>Output Format</b><br>
For each test case, print the number of hens (if possible otherwise print<b> -1</b> ) in  new line.<br><br>
