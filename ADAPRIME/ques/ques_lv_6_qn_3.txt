<p>Hello friends, I am Malati. Today me and ( one of ) my friend Mina have a plan to leave this place. People claim to visit orphanage when they come here. My friend will go to Sir with an application to leave. Other's don't but I know he's cruel and will cancel the request (Assume this process will take 30sec) and will try to catch her. Then she will run to the gate to get into the public bus. I will also run away after she reaches the bus and stops it. After bus stops I will run towards the bus and I will avoid the path where she passed through so as not to get caught. I may run through the junctions of each hall but not in the same path that she went through. I got all the timings recorded with me to pass through each hall of this dirty place. I know she will take the shortest path in fear. The bus comes to the gate at <b>14:59:00</b> today. Mina is standing at the door of the office of Sir. Can you tell Mina at which time she should go inside to meet Sir ? Don't worry for us if its not possible, just say "Not possible" and we will make some other plans in future :). Thank you for making a program that will help us plan better.

<b>Input Format</b><br>
The first line of input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. <br>
Each test case contains:
<ol>
<li><b>VID</b>, the vertex id of the gate where the bus reaches.</li>
<li><b>M</b>, the number of the hallway.</li>
<li><b>M</b> number of lines each containing <b>A</b> ( denoting one end of hallway ) , <b>B</b> ( denoting other end of hallway ) , and <b>C</b> ( denoting the time in seconds that will be taken to traverse the hallway ) separated by a space</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<b>Constraints</b>
<ul>
<li>1<=<b>T</b><=10</li>
<li>1<=<b>VID</b><=60</li>
<li>1<=<b>M</b><=60</li>
<li>1<=<b>A</b><=60</li>
<li>1<=<b>B</b><=60</li>
<li>1<=<b>C</b><=60</li>
</ul>
<b>Output Format</b><br>
