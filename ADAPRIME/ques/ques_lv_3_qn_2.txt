NIT, Trichy is carrying out an operation to plant trees to contribute in saving the environment. They want to do it on a large scale and in a fun way! They want to plant <b>X</b> type of trees and a total of <b>N</b> trees. Now here comes the fun part :<br>
1. The trees should be planted in a circular manner. Each circle of trees should <b>atmost</b> contain only <b>M</b> trees.<br>
2. In the beginning, the frequency of each tree which will be planted will start from 1. Once all the X types of trees are each planted once then the frequency of each tree to be planted will increment by 1. This will go on until N trees are planted.<br><br>
Now your job is to help them determine the following:<br>
1.The i<sup>th</sup> type of tree which be the last one to be planted.<br>
2.The number of circles of trees formed.

<br><br>

<b>Input Format</b><br>
The first line of input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. <br>
Each test case contains 3 values denoting :<br>
1.<b>X</b>: type of trees to be planted.<br>
2.<b>M</b>: maximum number of trees that can be planted in one circle.<br>
3.<b>N</b>: Total number of trees to be planted.<br>
<br>
<b>Constraints</b>
<ul>
<li>1<=<b>T</b><=10</li>
<li>1<=<b>X</b><=10<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>1<=<b>M</b><=100</li>
<li>0<=<b>N</b><=10<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>
<b>Output Format</b><br>
For each test case, print the i<sup>th</sup> type of tree which will be planted last followed by the number of circles of trees which are formed.<b>I</b> will fall in the range <b>[1,M]</b>.<br>

<b>Sample Input</b> <br>
1<br>
3<br>
5<br>
20<br>

<b>Sample output</b><br>
1 4<br><br>
<b>Explanation</b><br>
<b>Test Case #00:</b> X = 3, M = 5, N = 20<br><br>

1st circle : A,B,C,A,A : 5 trees planted, 15 left<br>
2nd circle : B,B,C,C,A : 10 trees planted, 10 left<br>
3rd circle : A,A,B,B,B : 15 trees planted, 5 left<br>
4th circle:C,C,C,A,A :20 trees planted<br>
Last tree to be planted was of 1st type.<br>
No of circles = 4<br>
